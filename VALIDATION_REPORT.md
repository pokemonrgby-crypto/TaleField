## AI Generation Guidelines

### Character/Shin Generation
- Damage: Normal 5-12, Strong 15-25, Max 30
- MP Cost: Normal 5-8, Strong 10-15
- Healing: 10-20 recommended

### Artifact Generation
- Weapon Attack: Normal 5-10, Strong 12-18, Max 20-30
- Armor Defense: Light 3-6, Medium 8-12, Heavy 15-25
- Item Healing: HP 10-20, MP 5-15
- Miracle Damage: Normal 8-15, Strong 20-30

## Known Limitations
1. Bot AI uses simplified strategy (can be enhanced)
2. Bot deck is fixed (could support customization)
3. No replay system yet
4. Statistics tracking not implemented

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)
1. Advanced bot AI with more complex strategies
2. Multiple bot characters with different play styles
3. Customizable bot decks
4. Replay and statistics system
5. Tournament mode with progressive difficulty

## Deployment Notes
- Firestore rules must be deployed: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
- Cloud Functions must be deployed: `firebase deploy --only functions`
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Backward compatible with existing code

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test bot room creation from lobby
2. Verify bot player appears in room
3. Test game start with bot
4. Verify bot makes automatic moves
5. Test all three difficulty levels
6. Verify Firestore rules prevent unauthorized access

## Performance Considerations
- Bot AI decision making is lightweight (~1-2 seconds)
- No significant impact on Cloud Functions quota
- Firestore reads/writes remain efficient
- UI animations are GPU-accelerated
